### Technologies used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): a component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces that uses declarative and functional concepts.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): as a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/): a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore): a NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client-side and server-side development.

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/): utilising tagged template literals and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct.

<!-- - [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx#readme): a utility for constructing className strings conditionally. -->

<!-- - [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): a Vite-native unit test framework. Vitest supports HMR which really speeds up your workflow. -->

<!-- - [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/): a simple and complete testing utilities that encourage good testing practices. -->

### Folders organization

- `components`: contains sub-components of pages. They either break down the functionality of such pages, or are extracted for code reuse between different pages.

- `pages`: contains the app's pages. These are the top-level components in the hierarchy and contain the main logic to render the sub-components.

- `templates`:

<!-- ### Tests

My main idea was to do E2E tests with Cypress, however, I was running out of time and I focused on testing isolated components instead.

I wrote a few component tests using vitest and react testing library. I tried to use jest but it seems it has some issues and limitations with vite. They seems to have pretty much the same syntax.

I wrote tests for:

- `Button`
- `TextField`
- `StockCard` -->
